    <h4> Side Scoller Game </h4>
    <p id="demo5" style="display:none"> 
 My side scroller game was Under the Sea themed.
      There are underwater animals as obstacles to avoid and the player is the seal. 
      The seal trys to avoid touching the sharks and fishes and can only move up and down.
